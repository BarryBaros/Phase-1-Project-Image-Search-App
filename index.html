<h5>1. How does the image search feature work?</h5>

The image search feature allows you to find images based on keywords. Simply enter a keyword related to the type of image you're looking for in the search bar and click the 'Search' button. The app will then fetch and display images related to your keyword from an external image database.

The images displayed in the app are sourced from external image databases such as Unsplash, which provide high-quality images that are often free to use for personal and commercial purposes. However, it's recommended to check the usage rights and licensing information for each image before using it for your specific purpose.
<h5>4. How frequently is the image database updated?</h5>

The image database is updated regularly by the external service provider. However, the frequency of updates may vary, and new images may be added to the database on a continuous basis.
